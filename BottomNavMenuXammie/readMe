Exploring Android’s Bottom Navigation View

The debate over whether tabs should go on the top or the bottom of a screen has raged for nearly a decade. 
Android has always preferred to use tabs as a filtering mechanism on the top of a page, while iOS has used bottom 
tabs as the main source of navigation. Now, with the addition of the Bottom Navigation View in the Support Design library,
Android developers have the choice of where their main navigation comes from in their applications.

Bottom navigation bars make it easy for your users to navigate through your top-level views with a single tap, compared 
the the navigation drawer that flies out from the side and has been a standard when there are a lot of different sections 
to an app. Today, I’ll walk through when it’s best to use bottom navigation in your app, how to implement it, and how to 
customize it to your liking.
